CLOSER-FLOAT

Closer to floating-point arithmetic.

Provide a common interface to IEEE 754 (a.k.a. ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559)
and ISO/IEC 10967 features.

If a symbol is not bound, then the corresponding feature is not
available.

rounding-mode ()
   Accessor for the floating-point rounding mode.
   Value is one of the following.
   
        :nearest-even
             Round to nearest, ties to even.
   
        :nearest-away
             Round to nearest, ties away from zero.
   
        :up
             Direct rounding towards positive infinity.
   
        :down
             Direct rounding towards negative infinity.
   
        :zero
             Direct rounding towards zero.
   
        nil
            Rounding mode is undefined.
   
   When setting the rounding mode, ‘:nearest’ is a synonym for
   ‘:nearest-even’.
   
   The ‘:nearest-away’ rounding mode is defined by IEEE 754 but
   not, for example, in the C floating-point environment ‘fenv.h’.
   Thus, chances are low that this rounding mode is supported.
