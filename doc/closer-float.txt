CLOSER-FLOAT

Closer to floating-point arithmetic.

Provide a common interface to IEEE 754 (a.k.a. ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559)
and ISO/IEC 10967 features.

The general rule is: If a symbol is not bound, then the corresponding
feature is not supported by the implementation.  Therefore, you can
use ‘boundp’ and ‘fboundp’ to check for a feature at run-time.

As an alternative, the Closer Float library also defines some feature
test macros to check for features at compile-time.  Below is a list of
all feature test macros together with their meaning.

closer-float-signed-zero
     True if there are distinct representations for positive and
     negative floating-point zero.  If so, the predicate functions
     ‘float-positive-zero-p’ and ‘float-negative-zero-p’ are defined
     for all float types.

closer-float-sign-symmetry
     True if there is sign symmetry in the range of floating-point
     numbers.  That means, for any positive floating-point number
     there is a corresponding negative floating-point number.  This
     includes positive and negative infinity if infinite numbers are
     defined.

closer-float-infinity
     True if the positive and negative infinity constants and the
     respective predicate functions ‘float-positive-infinity-p’ and
     ‘float-negative-infinity-p’ are defined for all float types.  If
     sign symmetry is defined, the sign symmetric infinity constants
     and the predicate function ‘float-infinity-p’ are defined, too.

closer-float-not-a-number
     True if a default not-a-number constant and the predicate
     function ‘float-not-a-number-p’ is defined for all float types.

closer-float-rounding-mode
     True if the floating-point rounding mode is accessible.

                                                                      [Constant]

rounding-mode ()
   Accessor for the floating-point rounding mode.
   
   Value is a rounding mode keyword.  Below is a table of known
   rounding mode keywords together with their meaning.
   
        :nearest-even
             Round to nearest, ties to even.
   
        :nearest-away
             Round to nearest, ties away from zero.
   
        :up
             Direct rounding towards positive infinity.
   
        :down
             Direct rounding towards negative infinity.
   
        :zero
             Direct rounding towards zero.
   
   When setting the rounding mode, ‘:nearest’ is a synonym for
   ‘:nearest-even’.
   
   The ‘:nearest-away’ rounding mode is defined by IEEE 754 as
   an option for the decimal floating-point formats.  It is not
   defined, for example, in the C floating-point environment
   ‘fenv.h’.  Thus, chances are low that this rounding mode is
   used in the implementation.
   
   The ‘rounding-mode-keywords’ variable lists the rounding mode
   keywords used in the implementation.
   
   A ‘program-error’ is signaled if you attempt to set a rounding
   mode not used in the implementation.

                                                                      [Constant]
