# Closer Float

Closer to floating-point arithmetic.

Provide a common interface to IEEE 754 (a.k.a. ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559)
and ISO/IEC 10967 features.

## Plan

- Implement basic features.
- Incorporate IEEE 754 test suites.
  - https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/projects/verification/fpgen/ieeets.html
  - https://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/software/ieee/
- Add support for other Lisp implementations.
